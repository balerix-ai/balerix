# Changelog

### Upgrading

- 0.2.0 gives every agent a private clone (Spec N). Before upgrading,
  `balerix down <fleet>` every fleet (`--keep-repos` keeps its branches;
  they seed the new clones), then `up` on 0.2.0. A 0.1.x agent left
  running is adopted as is, under its old sandbox, until it is next
  materialized (its session exits, a setting changes, or the daemon starts
  with no live session); it is then refused with `created by balerix 0.1
  as a worktree` — push unpushed work, then `balerix down <fleet> --purge`
  (or `--keep-repos`) and `up`. From 0.2.0 only an agent's assigned branch
  survives `down --keep-repos`, a removal or a `branch` change; other local
  branches and the working tree go with the clone.
